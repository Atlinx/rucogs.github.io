                    <p>The Rutgers University Creation of Games Society is dedicated to researching, learning, understanding, and teaching the techniques and theories used in video game development in an environment to foster growth in students who have a passion for game design. The meetings provide a place for members to expand their knowledge of concepts and design paradigms used in video game development and broaden mindsets for future use in related fields. COGS encourages collaboration and communication between the different disciplines that encompass game development, including but not limited to: computer science, visual art, music composition, and creative writing. The ultimate goal of COGS is to help stimulate growth in all aspects of game development and supply students with relevant skills applicable to future careers
